# Blog-Website
Developed a blog website using Flask, a Python web framework. 
The website allows users to view blog posts, register, log in, and comment on posts. 
Utilized _Flask-Bootstrap_ for styling and _Flask-CKEditor_ for a rich text editor. 
Implemented _user authentication and password hashing_ for secure registration and login.
Users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts. The website also features an About and Contact page. 
The backend is powered by _SQLAlchemy_ for data storage, and _Flask-Gravatar_ to display user avatars. 
While the frontend template was downloaded, the focus was on the Python backend, data models, and user authentication.
